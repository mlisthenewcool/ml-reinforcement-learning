# Reinforcement Learning (RL)

[![Total alerts](https://img.shields.io/lgtm/alerts/g/mlisthenewcool/ml-reinforcement-learning.svg?logo=lgtm&logoWidth=18)](https://lgtm.com/projects/g/mlisthenewcool/ml-reinforcement-learning/alerts/)

This repository provides code, links and reflexions of various methods to learn from interaction in order to achieve goals. Ideas and structure relies heavily on theoretical materials from [Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto's Reinforcement Learning book (2nd edition)](http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2018.pdf).

All code is written in Python 3.6+. Some environments are provided by [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/).
